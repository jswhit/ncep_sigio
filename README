The easy (I hope) way...
------------------------

To build the sigio library, you can use the "make_sigio_lib.sh" script specifying
the build configuration. The available build configurations are:
  gfortran-debug  ifort-debug  pgf95-debug  xlf2003-debug
  gfortran        ifort        pgf95        xlf2003

So, on WCOSS/tide you would type:

  $ make_sigio_lib.sh ifort


On the CCS you would type

  $ make_sigio_lib.sh xlf2003


This script sets the appropriate environment variables and then configures, builds, 
and installs the library.

Some additional points:
- Both GNU-type and NCO-type installs are performed.
- The library is installed relative to the current directory.

You can tailor the build process using this "make_sigio_lib.sh" script by
modifying the relevant build configuration setup file in the "config-setup/"
subdirectory.



The more flexible way
---------------------

If you need more flexibility in the library build you can specify the necessary 
information directly to the configure script that generates the makefiles. For
example, on WCOSS/tide:

  $ ./configure --prefix=${PWD} \
                FC="ifort" \
                FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -xHOST -traceback -free -convert big_endian -assume byterecl"

The --prefix switch sets the installation directory and defaults to /usr/local so
make sure you set it to a directory in which you have write access.

The definition of the "FC" enviroment variable is not strictly necessary as it defaults
to "ifort" on linux systems if available (followed by "gfortran" and "pgf95" if not), and
to "xlf2003" on AIX systems.

Use the configure script method of generating the makefiles if you want to use different
compiler switches, or install the library in a different location, e.g.

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usrx/local/nceplibs

To start the library build for a particular configuration, simply type

  $ make

To install the library in a directory conforming to the NCO organisation and
naming conventions, type:

  $ make nco_install

To perform a GNU-type install, type:

  $ make install
