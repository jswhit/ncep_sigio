To build the sigio library, you can specify the necessary information directly to
the configure script that generates the makefiles. For example, on WCOSS/tide:

  $ ./configure --prefix=${PWD} \
                FC="ifort" \
                FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -xHOST -traceback -free -convert big_endian -assume byterecl"

The --prefix switch sets the installation directory and defaults to /usr/local so
make sure you set it to a directory in which you have write access.

The definition of the "FC" enviroment variable is not strictly necessary as it defaults
to "ifort" on linux systems if available (followed by "gfortran" and "pgf95" if not), and
to "xlf2003" on AIX systems.

To start the library build for a particular configuration, simply type

  $ make

To install the library in a directory conforming to the NCO organisation and
naming conventions, type:

  $ make nco_install

To perform a GNU-type install, type:

  $ make install

The "config-setup/" subdirectory contains some sample build configuration setup files
for use with the supported compilers. The available setup files are:

  $ ls config-setup/
  gfortran-debug.setup  ifort-debug.setup  pgf95-debug.setup  xlf2003-debug.setup
  gfortran.setup        ifort.setup        pgf95.setup        xlf2003.setup
  
These files can be used with the configure script. For example, a gfortran build can be
achieved like so:

  $ . config-setup/gfortran.setup ; ./configure --prefix=$PWD

Use and/or modify the setup files as required.
